 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?


 In JavaScript, the this keyword is a special identifier that refers to the context in which a function is executed. It is dynamically bound and its value depends on how a function is invoked. The purpose of the this keyword is to provide a way to access and manipulate the properties and methods of the current object or the object on which a function is called.

 Explicit binding: In JavaScript, the this binding can also be explicitly set using methods like call(), apply(), or bind(). These methods allow you to specify the value of this within a function explicitly.
The this keyword plays a crucial role in JavaScript to refer to the context in which a function is executed, whether it's an object method, a standalone function, or a constructor function. It enables access to object properties and methods dynamically, providing flexibility and reusability in JavaScript code.
