Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?
Ans: 
There are several types of selectors in CSS­­­ that allow you to target and style specific elements on a web page. The different types of selectors are:

1. Element Selectors: Element selectors target elements based on their tag name. For example, to select all paragraphs (<p> elements), you would use the selector p. Element selectors have the advantage of being simple and easy to use. They apply styles to all elements of the specified type, making it useful for applying consistent styles across similar elements.
2. Class Selectors: Class selectors target elements based on the value of their class attribute. A class selector is denoted by a dot followed by the class name. For example, to select all elements with the class "highlight", you would use the selector .highlight. Class selectors provide a way to group and style multiple elements with a shared class, allowing for more targeted and specific styling.
3. ID Selectors:ID selectors target a single element based on the value of its id attribute. An ID selector is denoted by a hash symbol followed by the ID name. For example, to select the element with the ID "header", you would use the selector #header. ID selectors offer high specificity and should be unique within the document. They are useful for styling individual elements or targeting specific elements for JavaScript manipulation.
4. Attribute Selectors:Attribute selectors target elements based on the presence or value of specific attributes. For example, [type="submit"] selects all elements with the attribute type set to "submit". Attribute selectors provide flexibility in selecting elements based on their attribute values, allowing for fine-grained control over styling and behavior.
5. Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Pseudo-classes select elements based on a specific state or condition. For example, :hover selects an element when the user hovers over it. Pseudo-elements select and style a specific part of an element. For example, ::before inserts content before an element. Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow you to add dynamic and interactive styles to elements based on user actions or document structure.

Advantages of using different types of selectors in CSS:
1. Specificity: Different types of selectors have different levels of specificity, allowing you to target elements with varying degrees of precision. This enables you to apply styles to specific elements or groups of elements as needed.
2. Reusability: Class selectors and ID selectors allow you to define styles that can be applied to multiple elements or reused across different parts of a website. This promotes code efficiency and consistency in styling.
3. Flexibility: Attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements provide additional ways to target and style elements based on specific conditions or states. This enhances the flexibility and interactivity of your stylesheets.
4. Modularity: By combining multiple selectors, you can create complex selectors that target specific elements or groups of elements, giving you granular control over styling and layout.
