Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?
Ans: 

HTML Tags
HTML tags are used to define the structure and presentation of content in an HTML document.
Tags mark the beginning and end of an HTML element.
Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >).
Examples of HTML tags include <div>, <p>, <h1>, <img>, etc.
HTML tags alone do not carry any content; they define the boundaries of HTML elements.

HTML Elements
HTML elements consist of HTML tags along with the content they enclose.
Elements define the structure and semantics of the content.
Elements consist of the opening tag, content, and closing tag.
Examples of HTML elements include <div>Hello World!</div>, <p>This is a paragraph.</p>, <h1>Heading</h1>, <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">, etc.
HTML elements include tags along with the actual content they surround, such as text, images, or nested elements.
