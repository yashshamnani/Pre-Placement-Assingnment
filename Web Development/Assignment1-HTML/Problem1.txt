Q. <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?
Ans : No, <!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag of HTML. It is a document type declaration (DTD). A DTD is a set of rules that defines the structure of an XML document. In the case of HTML, the DTD specifies the elements that can be used in an HTML document, as well as the attributes that can be associated with those elements. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is the first line of every HTML document. It tells the browser which version of HTML the document is written in. This ensures that the web page is rendered correctly by the browser.
