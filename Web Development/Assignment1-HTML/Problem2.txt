Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?
Ans: In HTML, semantic tags are specific elements that provide meaning and context to the content within them. They describe the purpose or role of the content, rather than just specifying its appearance. Semantic tags are designed to enhance the structure and accessibility of a web page by providing clearer and more meaningful information to both browsers and developers. e.g. <header> , <nav>, <footer>, <section>
By using semantic tags, developers can create well-organized, accessible, and maintainable websites. They also contribute to better search engine optimization (SEO) as search engines can better understand the content and context of a page. Additionally, semantic tags promote consistency and understanding among developers collaborating on a project, making it easier to work with and share code.
