Q.6 What are some of the advantages of HTML5 over its previous versions?
Ans: 
HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, offers several advantages over its previous versions. Some of the key advantages of HTML5 are:
    1.Improved Multimedia Support: HTML5 provides native support for audio and video elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. This makes it easier to embed multimedia content on web pages and enhances compatibility across different devices and browsers.
    2. Canvas Element: HTML5 introduces the <canvas> element, which allows dynamic rendering of graphics, animations, and visualizations directly within the web page. It enables developers to create interactive and visually rich experiences without relying on external technologies.
    3.Mobile-Friendly and Responsive Design: HTML5 is designed with mobile devices in mind. It includes features such as responsive design techniques, which allow web pages to adapt and scale to different screen sizes. This makes it easier to create mobile-friendly and responsive web applications.
    4.Improved Form Input Types: HTML5 introduces several new input types for forms, such as email, date, time, number, and range. These input types provide better user experience, input validation, and semantic markup for form elements.
    5.Geolocation: HTML5 incorporates a Geolocation API, allowing websites to access and utilize the user's location information (with their permission). This feature enables location-based services, mapping applications, and personalized experiences.
