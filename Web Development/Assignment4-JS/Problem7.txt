Q.7 Whatâ€™s difference between map & forEach?
Ans:
The map() and forEach() methods are both used to iterate through arrays in JavaScript. However, there are some key differences between the two methods.
map()
- Returns a new array with the results of the callback function applied to each element of the original array.
- The callback function takes two arguments: the current element of the array and the index of the element.
- The callback function can return any value, including a primitive value, an object, or even another array.

forEach()
- Does not return anything.
- The callback function takes one argument: the current element of the array.
- The callback function cannot return anything.
