Q.2 Explain Temporal Dead Zone?
Ans: 
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept in JavaScript that refers to the period of time between the declaration of a variable and the moment when the variable is actually initialized with a value. During the TDZ, the variable cannot be accessed, and if you try to access it, you will get a ReferenceError.
The TDZ only applies to variables that are declared using the let or const keywords. Variables that are declared using the var keyword do not have a TDZ.
Example:
let foo;
console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
foo = 'bar';
console.log(foo); // bar
