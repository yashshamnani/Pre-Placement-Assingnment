Q.8 How can you destructure objects and arrays in ES6?
Ans:
Destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from objects and arrays into variables. This can be useful for making your code more concise and easier to read.
There are two types of destructuring: object destructuring and array destructuring.
Object destructuring
Object destructuring allows you to extract the values of specific properties from an object into variables. For example, the following code destructures the person object into the name and age variables:
Code:
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
};
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // John Doe
console.log(age); // 30
The { name, age } part of the code is called a destructuring pattern. The destructuring pattern specifies the properties that you want to extract from the object. In this case, the destructuring pattern specifies that you want to extract the name and age properties.
The destructuring pattern can be used to extract any number of properties from an object. For example, the following code destructures the person object into the name, age, and occupation variables:

JavaScript
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
  occupation: 'Software Engineer',
};
const { name, age, occupation } = person;
console.log(name); // John Doe
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(occupation); // Software Engineer

Array destructuring
Array destructuring allows you to extract the values of specific elements from an array into variables. For example, the following code destructures the numbers array into the first and second variables:

Code:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second] = numbers;
console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2

The [first, second] part of the code is called a destructuring pattern. The destructuring pattern specifies the elements that you want to extract from the array. In this case, the destructuring pattern specifies that you want to extract the first and second elements.
The destructuring pattern can be used to extract any number of elements from an array. For example, the following code destructures the numbers array into the first, second, and third variables:
Code:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [first, second, third] = numbers;
console.log(first); // 1
console.log(second); // 2
console.log(third); // 3

Destructuring is a powerful feature that can make your code more concise and easier to read. It is a good practice to use destructuring whenever possible.
