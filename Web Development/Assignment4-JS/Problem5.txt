Q.5 What is the difference between let and const ?
Ans: 
Here is the difference between let and const:
let:
- Allows variable reassignment: Variables declared with let can be reassigned new values after their initial declaration.
- Block-scoped: let variables are limited to the block in which they are defined (such as within loops or if statements).
- No hoisting: let variables are not hoisted, meaning they cannot be accessed before their declaration in the code.

const:
- Does not allow reassignment: Variables declared with const are constants and cannot be reassigned once they are defined. The initial value assigned to a const variable is fixed.
- Block-scoped: const variables are limited to the block in which they are defined.
- No hoisting: const variables are not hoisted and cannot be accessed before their declaration.
