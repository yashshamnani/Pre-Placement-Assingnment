Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

setTimeout and setInterval are functions in JavaScript that allow you to schedule the execution of a function or a block of code after a specific time interval.

setTimeout:
The setTimeout function is used to schedule the execution of a function or code block once, after a specified delay in milliseconds. It takes two parameters: a function or code to be executed and the delay in milliseconds.
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed function executed after 2000 milliseconds");
}, 2000);

setInterval:
The setInterval function is used to repeatedly execute a function or code block at a fixed interval. It takes two parameters: a function or code to be executed and the interval in milliseconds.

var counter = 0;
var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Interval function executed every 1000 milliseconds");
  counter++;
  if (counter === 5) {
    clearInterval(intervalId); // Stop the interval after 5 executions
  }
}, 1000);
